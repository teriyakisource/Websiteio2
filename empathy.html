            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <br>
            <li>Pain. Affected joints might hurt during or after movement.
            <li>Stiffness. Joint stiffness might be most noticeable upon awakening or after being inactive.
            <li>Tenderness. Your joint might feel tender when you apply light pressure to or near it.
            <li>Loss of flexibility. You might not be able to move your joint through its full range of motion.
            <li>Grating sensation. You might feel a grating sensation when you use the joint, and you might hear popping or crackling.
            <li>Bone spurs. These extra bits of bone, which feel like hard lumps, can form around the affected joint.
            <li>Swelling. This might be caused by soft tissue inflammation around the joint.

            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our goal was to design something for Brenda that she can use and will improve her life. 
            <br>
            <br>
                We came up with several ideas - An ergonomic food knife, an easy-to-use cardholder and a palmrest to imrove her typing accuracy. We decided upon the Cardholder.

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Initial designs were cut out and made in paper, then in cardboard.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Cardboard Model</h3>

            <div class="cboardImg">

            <h2>Changes and Decisions</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Through the models, we decided on more and more ergonomic adaptations, adapting the product for Brenda. The cardboard model had a few more cutouts in order to assist the card in getting to its expanded state.</h3>

            <h2>Computer-aided Design</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>We started to design models in OnShape, a free web-browser-based application used to design small-scale products.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="cadImg">
                <img src="images/v1.png"width="40%"/>
                <img src="images/v2.png"width="40%"/>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Between the first and second image, the only difference was the edges. They were rounded for both safety and Aesthetics. A small cutout at the back was also made.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Mechanism</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The idea was to have an easy to push button pull out the cards in the formation of a fan. This could be done using a "crocodile-tooth" arm which pushes the cards down into that formation. The bottn would be operated on the side of the device.</p>
